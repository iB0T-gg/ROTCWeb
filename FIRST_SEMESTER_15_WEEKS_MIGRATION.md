- **Aptitude Score Calculation**: Updated threshold from 100 to 150 points for maximum aptitude score

### 2. Database Changes
- **New Columns Added**: 
  - `merits_week_11` through `merits_week_15` 
  - `demerits_week_11` through `demerits_week_15`
- **Data Migration**: Extended all 151 existing first semester records from 10 to 15 weeks
- **Array Updates**: Updated `merits_array` and `demerits_array` to contain 15 elements
