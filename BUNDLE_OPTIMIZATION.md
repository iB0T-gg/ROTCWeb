# Bundle Optimization Guide

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification" warning by implementing proper code splitting and manual chunking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `vite.config.js`
- Added manual chunking strategy to separate vendor libraries and application code
- Increased chunk size warning limit to 1000 kB
- Organized chunks by functionality:
  - `react-vendor`: React, React DOM, Inertia React
  - `toast-vendor`: React Toastify
  - `icons-vendor`: React Icons
  - `ui-vendor`: HeadlessUI, Heroicons
  - `vendor`: Other node_modules
  - `admin-pages`: Admin functionality
  - `user-pages`: User functionality  
  - `faculty-pages`: Faculty functionality
  - `auth-pages`: Authentication pages
  - `components`: Reusable components

### 2. Updated `app.jsx`
- Removed `eager: true` from page imports to enable lazy loading
- Pages are now loaded on-demand instead of all at once

## Results
The build now creates smaller, more manageable chunks:
- Main app: 5.19 kB
- Components: 16.37 kB
- Auth pages: 21.74 kB
- User pages: 36.57 kB
- Admin pages: 72.42 kB
- Faculty pages: 77.02 kB
- Vendor libraries: 195.28 kB
- React vendor: 337.13 kB

## Benefits
1. **Faster initial page load** - Only core chunks are loaded initially
2. **Better caching** - Vendor chunks change less frequently
3. **Improved performance** - Pages load on-demand
4. **Better debugging** - Clearer separation of concerns

## Additional Optimization Tips
1. Consider using React.lazy() for very large components
2. Implement route-based code splitting if needed
3. Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries used conditionally
4. Monitor bundle size regularly with `npm run build`

## Monitoring
Run `npm run build` to see current chunk sizes and ensure they stay manageable.
